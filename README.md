# Validity-Of-Numeric-Expression
This is a C project in which the user enters a numerical expression. Most of the numerical expressions will contain some or all of these characters: 
  
  '( )',
   
  '[ ]',
  
  '{ }'.
  
  Sadly, there are a lot of times when someone types the expression but forgets to open/close a bracket or closes the brackets in a wrong order.
  This makes the expression invalid and there will be no result. 
  
  The purpose of this program is to check if the numerical expression is valid, more specifically if all the brackets have been opend and closed correctly.
  
  The program solves the problem with the help of Stacks.
